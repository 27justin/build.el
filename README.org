#+description: Build Bazel targets directly through Emacs

This package allows you to directly build [[https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel][Bazel]] projects within Emacs
without memorizing the targets.


* Usage

bzl.el exposes these interactive commands
+ ~bzl/run~
+ ~bzl/build~
+ ~bzl/test~

It tries to be smart with queries to only show the likely appropiate
targets for the given command (i.e. run/test).  ~bzl/build~ lists all
targets the project has.

* Demo

#+html: <video loop autoplay controls src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5dfb9f29-300b-4b19-97c3-681b96098100"></video>

* Installation

** Manually
Clone the repository:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
 git clone https://github.com/27justin/bzl.el ~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/bzl.el
#+END_SRC

Add it to your load path

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/bzl.el")
  (require 'bzl)
#+END_SRC

Done.
